## Architecture

The Samelogic SDK is separated into 2 systems:

1. The Samelogic Client SDK - this is the main library that you interact with, it contains the `SamelogicClient`.
2. The Samelogic Steps - these are workflow steps that are dynamically loaded after the SamelogicClient is initialized.

## Self-hosted

The Samelogic SDK allows you to utilize the power of the workflow execution without the Samelogic Platform, requiring no `APP_ID`. You can supply all the data it needs to execute workflows from your source, such as your API or hard-coded.

By leaving off the `appId` and replacing it with the [`workflows`](/references/sdks/web/reference/samelogic-js.options.workflows) property.
The SDK will run using the supplied workflows and will not need to communicate with Samelogic APIs. For more detailed information on the SDK usage, see the [Javascript SDK Reference](/references/sdks/web/reference/samelogic-js).

The shape of this config would look like the code below.

```javascript
Samelogic.init({
  workflows: [{
    name: 'my-workflow',
    trigger: {...},
    steps: [{...}]
  }]
});
```

:::info
Self-hosted Samelogic will not be able to track and provide analytics and insights into your workflows and experiments.

### Workflows

Workflows represent a set of steps that needs to be taken when some event is triggered. For more detailed information, see [Workflows](/workflows).

The Workflow schema consists of 2 main parts:

- Trigger - An optional object containing a list of events that can constrain when the workflow is executed.
- Steps - A list of asynchronous processes that are executed sequentially when the workflow is triggered.

The shape of a workflow would look like the code below.

```javascript
{
  name: 'my-workflow',
  trigger: {...},
  steps: [{...}]
}
```

See the [`WorkflowConfig`](/references/sdks/web/reference/samelogic-js.WorkflowConfig) for more details on the schema.

### Trigger

Triggers are made up of events. All event conditions must be met for the workflow to be triggered. If this is not provided, the workflow is triggered immediatly when the SDK is initialized. For more detailed information, see [Triggers](/workflows/triggers).

```javascript
{
  name: 'my-workflow',
  trigger: {
    events: [{
      event: 'ElementClick',
      cssSelector: '#my-btn'
    },
    {
      event: 'PageView',
      urlPattern: 'https://samelogic.com/docs/*'
    }]
  },
}
```

The trigger above will start the workflow when the element with the id `my-btn` is clicked on any page of the `https://samelogic.com/docs` url.

See the [`TriggerConfig`](/references/sdks/web/reference/samelogic-js.TriggerConfig) for more details on the schema.

### Steps

Steps are processes that are executed within your workflow. For more detailed information, see [Steps](/steps).

Steps contain four main pieces of information:

1. `name` - this can be used by dependent steps to determine dependency or used in data mapping.
2. `needs` - this property determines what step it depends on. It uses a combination of `name` and the name of the `event` that the step exposes.
3. `uses` - this can be the official name and version of the step or a url to a custom step.
4. `props` - this is the input of the step. Data can be passed in directly, or mapping information can be passed in. See the [Data Mapping](/workflows/data_mapping) for more details.

Please refer to the documentation for each step to see what the schema of the `props` are like and what events are exposed.

```javascript
[
  {
    name: "first-step",
    uses: "@samelogic-steps/beacons@0.9",
  },
  {
    name: "second-name",
    needs: {
      name: "first-step",
      event: "OnClick",
    },
    uses: "https://url-of-your-step",
    props: {
      prop: "{{first-step.OnClick.ElementId}}",
    },
  },
];
```

The example above shows two steps. When the workflow is triggered, `first-step` will execute. The second step, `second-step` will then execute when `first-step` fires off the `OnClick` event.

See the [`StepConfig`](/references/sdks/web/reference/samelogic-js.StepConfig) for more details on configuring a step.

### Demo

Below is a full demo of a project that accomplishes the following:

1. Attach a Beacon to an element.
2. When the Beacon is clicked, it starts a Microsurvey step.
3. When the Microsurvey is submitted, it sends the data to a Webhook step which does an HTTP POST.
