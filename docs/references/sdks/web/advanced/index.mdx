## Architecture

The Samelogic SDK is separated into 2 systems:

1. The Samelogic Client SDK - this is the main library that you interact with, it contains the `SamelogicClient`.
2. The Samelogic Steps - these are workflow steps that are dynamically loaded after the SamelogicClient is initialized.

## Self-hosted

The Samelogic SDK allows you to utilize the power of the workflow execution without the Samelogic Platform, requiring no `APP_ID`. You can supply all the data it needs to execute workflows from your own source, such as your own API or hard coded.

By leaving off the `appId` and replacing it with the [project](/references/sdks/web/reference/samelogic-js.clientProject) property.
The SDK will run using the supplied project settings and will not need to communicate with Samelogic APIs.

:::info
Self-hosted Samelogic will not be able to track and provide analytics and insights into your workflows and experiments.

### Workflows

Workflows represent a set of steps that needs to be taken when some event is triggered.

### Steps

Steps are processes that are executed within your workflow. Steps are executed **asynchronously** and are long running. Steps exposes events that can be used to run subsequent steps.

:::info
You can build your own custom steps and host them whereever you want and refer to it by its url.
