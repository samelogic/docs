## samelogic-js package

Samelogic SDK contains the client that is required to run your Samelogic Projects in your product.

The main entry point to samelogic.js is the [Samelogic](./samelogic-js.samelogic.md) class, which when instantiated with an appId, will return an object that is ready to use. This object requires an init() method to be called for the client to start.
