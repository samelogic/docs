## Architecture

The Samelogic SDK is separated into 2 systems:

1. The Samelogic Client SDK - this is the main library that you interact with, it contains the `SamelogicClient`.
2. The Samelogic Steps - these are workflow steps that are dynamically loaded after the SamelogicClient is initialized.

## Using without Samelogic Platform

The Samelogic SDK allows you to utilize the power of the workflow execution without the Samelogic Platform, requiring no `ENVIRONMENT_ID`.

```javascript
const options = {
  clientProject: {...}
};
const samelogic = new Samelogic("", options);
samelogic.init();
```
