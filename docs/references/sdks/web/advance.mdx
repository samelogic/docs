## Architecture

The Samelogic SDK is separated into 2 systems:

1. The Samelogic Client SDK - this is the main library that you interact with, it contains the `SamelogicClient`.
2. The Samelogic Steps - these are workflow steps that are dynamically loaded after the SamelogicClient is initialized.

## Self-hosted

The Samelogic SDK allows you to utilize the power of the workflow execution without the Samelogic Platform, requiring no `APP_ID`.

This requires leaving off the `appId` and replacing it with the [clientProject](/references/sdks/web/reference/samelogic-js.clientproject) property property.
The SDK will run without any communication to Samelogic APIs. It will load the steps from the url specified in the config. This allows
you to use the SDK without requiring access to our servers.

```javascript
async Samelogic.init({
  clientProject: {
    name: 'A project name',
    workflows: [
      {
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
});
```

:::info
Without the `APP_ID`, Samelogic will not be able to track and provide analytics and insights into your workflows and experiments.
