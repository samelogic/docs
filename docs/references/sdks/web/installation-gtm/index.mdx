## SDK Installation - Google Tag Manager

You can install the Samelogic javascript SDD via Google-Tag-Manager (GTM) via our tag template. This
allows a fast way to install and configure the script on the website without any knowledge of coding.

## Installing via GTM

Installing the SDK in GTM can be in the following steps:

1. Setup variables.
2. Setup tag.
3. Deploy tag.

### 1. Setup variables

We are going to create a variable that will hold our Samelogic's `APP_ID`.

1. Navigate to the following: Variables > User-Defined Variables > New
2. Give your variable a name, something like `SAMELOGIC_PROD_APP_ID`. You can have multiple environments, so keep the name specific.
3. Choose variable type **Constant**.
4. In the _value_ field, enter your `APP_ID`.

:::info
Your `APP_ID` is found in the Project Settings page.

### 2. Setup tag

We are going to setup the tag that will install the SDK on the website.

1. Navigate to the following: Tags > New > Tag Configuration > Choose tag type.
2. Click the _Community Template Gallery_ button > Search for `Samelogic` template.
3. Click the Samelogic template > Add to workspace.
4. On the configure screen, look for `APP_ID` and then select the variable `SAMELOGIC_PROD_APP_ID`. You can also use a template string here, `{{SAMELOGIC_PROD_APP_ID}}.
5. Set the Triggering to be **All Pages**.

### Deploy tag

Submit the Workspace, create the revision and then save.

Check the url of your website, look in the network tab and check if `*/samelogic.min.js` was loaded.
