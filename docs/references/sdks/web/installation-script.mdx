# SDK Installation - Script

You can install the Samelogic javascript SDK directly by code in your product. You can achieve this by using a quick copy and paste of a small snippet. A more developer-friendly way is also provided so front-end developers can include the package via npm and use it during development.

### Installing via the Snippet

You can install the Javascript SDK using a small snippet of code that you paste on your website. This will be a short piece of Javascript that you will include
in your HTML that will asynchronously load the SDK into your website. This is loaded asynchronously not to block loading any other content on the page.

The snippet should be placed on every page that you want Samelogic to interact with. The snippet should be pasted at the bottom, just before the `</html>` tag, replacing the `APP_ID` with
your App Id.

:::info
Your `APP_ID` is found in the Project Settings page.
:::

The following snippet will load and initialize the SDK. Please replace _YOUR_APP_ID_ with the `APP_ID`.

```markup
<script>
  window.slAsyncInit = function() {
    Samelogic.init({
      appId : 'YOUR_APP_ID',
    });
  };
</script>
<script async defer crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://cdn.samelogic.com/lib/samelogic.min.js"></script>
```

This code will load the script from our CDN.

### Installing with npm or yarn

Alternatively, you can install the [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@samelogic/samelogic-js) and embed the SDK directly in your product.

Install using NPM:

```bash
npm install @samelogic/samelogic-js
```

Install using yarn

```bash
yarn add @samelogic/samelogic-js
```

This will now allow you to import samelogic in your project:

```javascript
import Samelogic from "@samelogic/samelogic-js";
```

## Usage & Examples

### Initialization

The SDK must be initialized before it can be used. The `APP_ID` for your Samelogic project is required.
The `Samelogic.init` method will start up Samelogic, and no further interaction is necessary. The default export is a class
with a static method `init()`.

```javascript
async Samelogic.init({
  appId: "APP_ID",
});
```

Behind the scenes, `init` will instantiate a new [**Samelogic**](/references/sdks/web/reference/samelogic-js.samelogic) instance and then initializes it.

The following code is an alternative but more developer-friendly. It allows you to interact with the object later on in more complex cases.

```javascript
const samelogic = new Samelogic({
  appId: "APP_ID"
});
async samelogic.init()
```

The SDK can also be utilized without the need for the Samelogic Platform. You can pass in your own Project and Workflow settings without the need of an `APP_ID`.
Please see the [advanced topics](/references/sdks/web/advanced#using-without-samelogic-platform).

### Environments

Samelogic allows you to configure multiple environments per project. Usually, this would be a _development_ and a _production_ environment.
The development environment should be used to test the integration of Samelogic and your product. The production environment should be used
for your live product. Data is not shared between environments.
