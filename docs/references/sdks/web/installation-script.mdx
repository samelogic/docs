## SDK Installation

### Installing via the Snippet

You can install the Javascript SDK using a small snippet of code that you paste on your website. The snippet should be placed on every page that
you want Samelogic to interact with. The snippet should be pasted at the bottom, just before the `</html>` tag, replacing the `ENVIRONMENT_ID` with
your Environment ID.

:::info
Your `ENVIRONMENT_ID` is found in the Project Settings page.
:::

```markup
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@samelogic/samelogic-js@2.0.4/dist/samelogic.min.js"></script>
<script>
const samelogic = new Samelogic("ENVIRONMENT_ID");
samelogic.init();
</script>

```

## Installing with npm or yarn

Alternatively, you can install the [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@samelogic/samelogic-js) and embed the SDK directly in the your product.

Install using NPM:

```bash
npm install @samelogic/samelogic-js
```

Install using yarn

```bash
yarn add @samelogic/samelogic-js
```

This will now allow you to import samelogic in your project:

```javascript
import Samelogic from "@samelogic/samelogic-js";
```

### Usage & Examples

#### Initialization

The exported default is a class and must be instantiated and initialized. The `ENVIRONMENT_ID` for your Samelogic project is required.
The `init` method will start up Samelogic and no further interaction is necessary.

```javascript
const samelogic = new Samelogic("ENVIRONMENT_ID");
samelogic.init();
```

Samelogic allows you to configure multiple environments per project. Usually this would be a _development_ and a _production_ environment.
Development environment should be used for testing the integration of Samelogic and your product, and the production environment should be used
for your live product. Data is not shared between environments.

#### Initialization with Options

Custom options can be passed into the constructor. A list of all possible options for the client can be found [here](./web/reference/samelogic-js.options).

```javascript
const options = {};
const samelogic = new Samelogic("ENVIRONMENT_ID", options);
samelogic.init();
```

:::info
Please note that if the object contains [options.clientProject](./web/reference/samelogic-js.workflowconfig) property, it will override the project related to the `ENVIRONMENT_ID`.
This will allow you to run the SDK with your own project configurations without getting it from the Samelogic Platform.
