# Webhooks Technical Reference

Webhooks are used for sending http requests to endpoints. It's common to use them for sending data about completed events or prior steps.

### Properties:

- `body` -
  The payload being sent to the endpoint.
- `method` -
  The http verb used to send the payload, i.e. `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc
- `url` -
  A valid http url.

### Events:

#### `OnSuccess`

- `data` -
  Response from endpoint.
- `status` -
  HTTP response status.

#### `OnFailure`

- `data` -
  Response from endpoint.
- `status` -
  HTTP response status.
- `message` -
  Reason for failure.

### Examples

#### Basic Usage

```json
{
  "name": "request",
  "uses": "https://unpkg.com/@samelogic-steps/webhooks@0.9.1/dist/runner.js",
  "props": {
    "url": "https://www.myendpoint.com/uploadhere",
    "method": "post",
    "body": "Hello World!"
  }
}
```

#### Passing Data From Steps

In this example, the results from a `microsurvey` step is being piped to an http endpoint once the microsurvey has been completed.

```json
{
  "name": "request",
  "needs": {
    "name": "microsurvey",
    "event": "OnSubmit"
  },
  "uses": "https://unpkg.com/@samelogic-steps/webhooks@0.9.1/dist/runner.js",
  "props": {
    "url": "https://www.myendpoint.com/uploadhere",
    "method": "post",
    "body": "{{microsurvey.OnSubmit.data}}"
  }
}
```

:::info
Note that the `{{microsurvey.OnSubmit.data}}` is used to pass data from a previous microsurvey step to the body property.
