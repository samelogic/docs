Webhooks are used to send data to any URL. Data from events can be piped in, serialized, and sent in the form of an HTTP request.

The main property that we care about is the `body`. This property is usually mapped to event data that triggered the step. The string is then serialized into a JSON object and sent in the `body` of the http request.

We currently recommend using webhooks to send data to a zapier endpoint for starting out. This can be connected to a [Zapier Webhook](https://zapier.com/page/webhooks/).
