Steps are **asynchronous** and long-running processes that are executed within your workflow. Steps can be connected to create complex workflows.

The initialization of a step can happen via a trigger or other step events.
Steps contain events that are fired based on their specification. Please refer to their docs for more details on what events they expose and under what criteria they are fired.

:::info
You can build your custom steps and host them wherever you want.
