Workflows make it easy to run various actions that should happen for an experiment. Workflows are made up of one or more steps that one or more trigger events can execute.

#### Triggers

Triggers are a list of events that occurs in the application to start the workflow. For example, you can configure a trigger to fire when the user clicks on an element on a specific page. Please see [Triggers Overview documentation](./workflows/triggers) for more details.

#### Steps

Steps are a set of actions that the workflow will execute after the trigger is fired. Please see [Steps Overview documentation](./steps)

### The stages of a Workflow

You can build your experiments by composing a workflow whose complexity can range from a simple painted door to a complex multi-variance test that collects a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

The experiment below is configured to collect feedback when the user clicks the checkout button on the checkout page.

You can configure the workflow to continue the default order behavior if the user has either canceled or submitted the feedback.

The workflow above contains two triggers that must match before the workflow begins executing the steps. The two triggers represent clicking a specific element while on a specified page.

The workflow contains two steps. A Microsurvey step will complete the workflow if it is canceled or pass the collected data to a Webhook step. The webhook step will attempt to send this data to a URL and will complete the workflow if the request fails or succeed.
