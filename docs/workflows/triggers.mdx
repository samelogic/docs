A trigger is a specific activity that starts a workflowâ€”for example, a user interaction within the application, such as clicking or hovering a button. A workflow will begin automatically when no trigger is specified.

You can combine triggers; all trigger conditions must be met for the workflow to execute. You can arrange triggers in a sequence that represents complex user flows that might need to happen.

We currently support the following triggers:

- Element Hover - When the user mouse over a specified element.
- Element Click - When the user clicks a specified element.
- Page View - When the user visits a specified page URL.

## Element Interactions

There are a few triggers available to start a workflow when the user interacts with your product elements. Setting up a trigger on a component requires some understanding of [CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors).

An example of a cssSelector is using the element ID such as `#my-element-id`, where `my-element-id` is the element's ID.

The available triggers for elements are:

1. `ElementClick`
2. `ElementMouseOver`
3. <a id="request-trigger-link" href="#">
     Request Trigger
   </a>

## Page Interactions

Triggers can be further constrained by the page URL pattern. Page View triggers will only allow a Workflow to be triggered if there is a match of the URL pattern, which can include wildcards.

The page trigger is known as `PageView`.

Example matches:

URL Pattern: `https://samelogic.com/*\/docs`

Matches:

- :white_check_mark: - `https://samelogic.com/myproduct/docs`
- :white_check_mark: - `https://samelogic.com/hello/docs?param=123`
- :x: - `https://samelogic.com/hello`

URL Pattern: `https://*.samelogic.com/`

Matches:

- :white_check_mark: - `https://app.samelogic.com/`
- :white_check_mark: - `https://app.samelogic.com/hello/docs?param=123`
- :x: - `https://should-not-run.samelogic.com/hello`
